(*Edit) It took me a whole day to get the repo all set up because there was a corrupted .img file in
one of the Unity AR package documents. That sucked. 

Experimenting with unity's ar features to increase domain knowledge for 360 video medical care center. 

Objective 1: Set up AR enviroment.
(I will be deploying to IOS because I do not have an android device to debug on.)

Step 1.1:
* Download xcode on Mac, Because I am using a Macbook Pro(2016) I can not use Xcode13 and will have to use a outdated version. (This may cause future errors).
* Set up unity enviroment for target device, in this case, Apple.

Step 1.2:
 WAs Not able to deploy to IOS because of Xcode Version I am at a standstill.
 
 # Dev Issue Breakdown:

I attempted t ocreate an AR application that would service IOS devices. This is because I do not own any other type of mobile device. Because of this I had to run builds on MACOS because it has Xcode. 
My Mac was produced in 2016 it is not able to upgrade to IOS13. IOS 13 is a dependancy for Xcode13 which is the Xcode version needed for this application. Because of these issues I will have to cease development and work on a design document
instead. This design document will be added to the repo for further grading.
